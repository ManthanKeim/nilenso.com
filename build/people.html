        Aninda graduated from BIT Mesra, with a degree in Electronics and
        Communication Engineering which he traded in favor of a life in
        programming. He started his career in HP where he spent 4 years
        learning how not to build software on the .NET platform (which he
        still loves).
        He delved into the world of startups where he was able to make a
        leap of faith into the world of TDD, REST, MVC, DRY, YAGNI, Git,
        ROR and other abbreviated coolness. He fell in love with software
        again and gravitated to a deep appreciation of agile philosophies
        and vows not to leave home without it.
        Aninda is passionate about building elegant working software and
        wanted to work with people who are too, when C42 answered his
        call. Here he plans to actively contribute back to open source,
        build value and live a little on the edge.

This grew into a legitimate love for the field after he crashed his Windows box in 2007 and managed a fragile triple-boot system that included a <a href="/web/20121130102453/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSx86">patched version of OS X</a>.
