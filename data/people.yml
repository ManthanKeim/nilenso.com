  name: "Jithu Gopal"
  bio: "Jithu has been developing web applications for five years, with the first three years almost exclusively on Java. He then chanced upon Ruby and has jumped ship never to look back again. He fancies throwing in words like agile, test driven development, broccoli whenever unsuitable. He has experience working on J2EE stack for products verifying carbon emission compliance. He helped in fleshing out the backend for an ad channel and notification service on Sinatra for an award winning iOS application. Among others, he worked for an open source survey application running of a Ruby on Rails stack and while at it, dabbled a bit into android application development. When not spaced out at work, he enjoys travelling, cycling and fair bit of air-guitaring. You do not want to be around when he goes into his falsetto thinking heâ€™s the next Justin Vernon."

    Here's a suit in disguise who's worn the hats of a developer, business analyst and salesman 
    in his earlier avatars. He laps up numbers and food in similar zest. When he's not being our Business Sherpa 
    he is pursuing his interests in quizzing, traveling and cooking.

  name: "Timothy Andrew"
  bio: >
    Timothy has been vaguely passionate about computers ever since he got all the way through Prince of Persia when he was five. This grew into a legitimate love for the field after he crashed his Windows box in 2007 and managed a fragile triple-boot system that included a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSx86">patched version of OS X</a>.

    Over the past year at Nilenso, he has learned Rails, helped build a suite of three <a href="https://github.com/nilenso/ashoka-survey-web">web</a>/<a href="https://github.com/nilenso/ashoka-survey-mobile">mobile</a> <a href="https://github.com/nilenso/ashoka-user-owner">apps</a> for a non-profit, and worked on <a href="http://wikenso.com/">Wikenso</a>.

    When he's not glued to a screen of some sort, he's introverted to a fault, likes to jam on the bass guitar, and play snooker.
