  name: "Aninda Kundu"
  bio: >
    <p>Aninda graduated from BIT Mesra, with a degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering which he traded in favor of a life in programming. He started his career in HP where he spent 4 years learning how not to build software on the .NET platform (which he still loves).</p>
    <p>He delved into the world of startups where he was able to make a leap of faith into the world of TDD, REST, MVC, DRY, YAGNI, Git, ROR and other abbreviated coolness. He fell in love with software again and gravitated to a deep appreciation of agile philosophies and vows not to leave home without it.</p>
    <p>Aninda is passionate about building elegant working software and wanted to work with people who are too, when Nilenso answered his call. Here he plans to actively contribute back to open source, build value and live a little on the edge.</p>

        Asif joined us after spending two years at MobME Wireless where he dabbled in telephony, picked up Ruby, and helped build the systems that powered a large-scale mobile content subscription service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past year and a half at C42 Engineering and Nilenso, he consulted on Rails projects including a private social network and and a virtual phone system. He's grown fond of pair-programming, TDD and even Javascript (only with frameworks, mind you) during this time. He believes <a href='#steven'>Steven Deobald</a> when he says Clojure is the next big thing, and hopes to deep dive into all the functional awesomeness soon.

       was spent writing Ruby at startups. He joined
      <a href='http://c42.in'>C42 Engineering</a> after a brief

      telephony infrastructure for some of India's largest Telco providers. He consulted on multiple Ruby on Rails projects at C42 Engineering, and
      was a member of the founding team behind <a href='http://rubymonk.com'>RubyMonk</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      At Nilenso, he partners with
      clients to build out their products, helps with product incubation, and
      generally go all gung-ho about the

      <p>
      Jithu has been developing web applications for five years, with the first three years
      almost exclusively on Java. He then chanced upon Ruby and has jumped ship never to look back again.
      Apart from web application development, he has been gathering intel on
      <a href="https://github.com/nilenso/ashoka-survey-web/">mobile application development</a>
      which he believes is the future.
      </p>
      <p>
      When not spaced out at work, he enjoys travelling, cycling and fair bit of air-guitaring.
      You do not want to be around when he goes into his falsetto thinking he's the next Justin Vernon.

  bio: "Nivedita joined Nilenso (then C42 Engineering) straight after finishing her engineering in computer science. She learned programming by building a school project in C++. Fortunately, C++ didn't have as adverse an impact on her as one would imagine. She has been dabbling with code ever since, and is now firmly in the Ruby camp. In the last one and half years, she worked on a suite of three open source applications built in Rails and wrote code for a product: a Twitter client app for groups. She loves learning new stuff and can these days be seen writing AngularJS with great happiness."

    <p>Timothy has been vaguely passionate about computers ever since he got all the way through Prince of Persia when he was five. This grew into a legitimate love for the field after he crashed his Windows box in 2007 and managed a fragile triple-boot system that included a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSx86">patched version of OS X</a>.</p>
    <p>Over the past year at Nilenso, he has learned Rails, helped build a suite of three <a href="https://github.com/nilenso/ashoka-survey-web">web</a>/<a href="https://github.com/nilenso/ashoka-survey-mobile">mobile</a> <a href="https://github.com/nilenso/ashoka-user-owner">apps</a> for a non-profit, and worked on <a href="http://wikenso.com/">Wikenso</a>.</p>

    <p>When he's not glued to a screen of some sort, he's introverted to a fault, likes to jam on the bass guitar, and play snooker.</p>
