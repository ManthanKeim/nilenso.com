  bio: >
    <p>Abhinav is the crust of the litter, you know? Old school JVM hacker. Loves log files. Wishes he was programming Haskell. The usual.</p>
    <p>Big data projects were his thing, but we ripped him from his comfortable Cave of Analysis and shoved him into a world of Clojure and Emacs. He's never stopped thanking us.</p>
    <p>He would love it if you'd go for a long bicycle ride to Mysore with him tomorrow. Bring some of those little bananas.</p>

    <p>Kitty started writing code with Borland Turbo C++ and Visual Basic in high-school, but then quickly moved to Ruby when he discovered <a href='http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/'>_why's poignant guide</a>. He was a part of GSOC'2011, and contributed to <a href='http://live.gnome.org/AkshayGupta_GnomeShell_Document'>GNOME</a>.</p>
    <p>Since then, he has hacked a fair bit of Ruby, consulted on a variety of Ruby on Rails projects, and helped build <a href='http://rubymonk.com'>RubyMonk</a>.</p>
    <p>He loves cycling, listening to noise rock, and has recently re-discovered his fondness for Snakeboarding.</p>

    <p>Jithu has been developing web applications for over half a decade, writing mostly in Java and Ruby. He is trying to catch up with the frenzy of NodeJS lately, and makes an effort to not clench teeth when exposed to the wonders of Javascript. </p>
    <p>When the internet goes down, you can find him hunched with a pair of binoculars, either observing birds or stars depending on the time of the day. He enjoys cycling and wishes to busk with a melodica some day.</p>

  name: "Nivedita Priyadarshini"
  bio: "Nivedita joined Nilenso (then C42 Engineering) straight after finishing her engineering in computer science. She learned programming by building a school project in C++. Fortunately, C++ didn't have as adverse an impact on her as one would imagine. She has been dabbling with code ever since, and is now firmly in the Ruby camp. In the last one and half years, she worked on a suite of three open source applications built in Rails and wrote code for a product: a Twitter client app for groups. She loves learning new stuff, and can these days be seen writing AngularJS with great happiness."

    Here's a suit in disguise who's worn the hats of a developer, business analyst and salesman
    in his earlier avatars. He laps up numbers and food with similar zest. When he's not being our Business Sherpa
    he is pursuing his interests in quizzing, traveling, and cooking.

  name: "Timothy Andrew"
  bio: >
    <p>Timothy has been vaguely passionate about computers ever since he got all the way through Prince of Persia when he was five. This grew into a legitimate love for the field after he crashed his Windows box in 2007, and managed a fragile triple-boot system that included a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSx86">patched version of OS X</a>.</p>
    <p>Over the past year at Nilenso, he has learned Rails, helped build a suite of three <a href="https://github.com/nilenso/ashoka-survey-web">web</a>/<a href="https://github.com/nilenso/ashoka-survey-mobile">mobile</a> <a href="https://github.com/nilenso/ashoka-user-owner">apps</a> for a non-profit, and worked on <a href="http://wikenso.com/">Wikenso</a>.</p>

    <p>When he's not glued to a screen of some sort, he's introverted to a fault, likes to jam on the bass guitar, and play snooker.</p>
