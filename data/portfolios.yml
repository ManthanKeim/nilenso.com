  quote: "Working with Nilenso was a true pleasure. My development team was stellar and on top of their game. Our project was 5 months long and they were a great fit. We're a startup and needed a team that could quickly adapt to customer feedback and pivots. We came to them with a broken codebase and they were able to clean up the mess and help us deliver our first working prototype. I would recommend them for any future Ruby project and hope to work with them again on our second phase of development."

  quote: "The coders at C42 are absolutely awesome - they're prolific about writing high quality code, and they've even taught us how to improve our engineering practices. They know how to make offshore development work well, and their communication skills are top-notch. By the end of the first week, they were working at full-speed, building new features, and executing on our infinitely long product roadmap. It was easier to onboard C42 than it was to onboard any other developer we've worked with. After interviewing almost a dozen other firms, we ultimately decided to work with C42."

  quote: "Niranjan & Tejas from C42 Engineering worked with us for over 4 months, and I can confidently say that they were among the finest folks that we've worked with. We had to wait for a couple of months before they came on board, but the wait was worth its while! These guys know their stuff; they are brilliant in design & coding, and patient & mature to nurture less experienced folks ramp up quickly to adopt agile & TDD principles. Over the short span of our engagement, they provided honest & valuable insights on improving our development processes, and made the whole experience memorable for the entire team."
