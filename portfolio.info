Customer Quote:
The coders at C42 are absolutely awesome - they’re prolific about writing high quality code, and they’ve even taught us how to improve our engineering practices. They know how to make offshore development work well, and their communication skills are top-notch. By the end of the first week, they were working at full-speed, building new features and executing on our infinitely long product roadmap. It was easier to onboard C42 than it was to onboard any other developer we’ve worked with. After interviewing almost a dozen other firms, we ultimately decided to work with C42.

Project Description:
We were brought in to help the team develop certain best practices like TDD & and Continuous Integration, while also delivering core business functionality.

Good luck to the C42 folks, ahead.

Customer Quote:
C42 has been amazing to work with. I've worked primarily with Aakash for the last 3 months, and have been really impressed. He is a rockstar engineer, maintains open channels of communication at all times and demonstrates a strong sense of ownership. Not only does he ensure that the implementation closely matches the business needs, but he also thinks through the user flow and makes great recommendations to improve the overall experience. I've also interacted to a limited extent with the rest of the team, and their values strongly mirror what I’ve seen with Aakash. I trust C42 completely with my product.

Project Description:
It is currently complicated and cumbersome to plan amazing international vacations. CleverBootz is going to change that. Their goal is to make the planning every bit as fun as the actual trip by re-thinking the process of international vacation planning as a fun, social experience.
CleverBootz approached us with 4 wireframes, a 2 page requirements document, a solid business plan and an amazing business team. It has been a roller coaster journey since then: while the overall goal was to deliver a prototype, things weren't that straightforward. The requirements changed a lot as we learned more about our users and the travel ecosystem on multiple continents. Using Rails and XP practices we were able to provide an environment where these changes could be accommodated really easily resulting in a prototype that was well received by customers on a tight schedule. We are continuing to work with CleverBootz as they build out their product.

Name:Unique Designs by Wanda
What: Multi-tenant, distributed inventory management and e-commerce application
Who: Ned Pearson, CEO , AlphaWebs LLC.

Customer Quote:
As an application development firm C42 Engineering has focus, agility, expertise and execution. They have tremendous knowledge of Rails, Ruby, JRuby, Ajax, Javascript, Git, Capistrano, and Linux and know how to apply this in real world situations. Collectively their team brings a comprehensive composite of talents, abilities, and skills to the table. The experience of working with C42 has been totally positive in terms of their amazing ability to craft a solution regardless of how unprecedented the task. They have a great work ethic and have always delivered the job on time and under budget.

Project Description:
We were approached to build a multi-tenant application that would allow a wholesale vendor of jewelery and fashion products to manange inventory, orders and shipping while allowing retail vendors to sell these products through their own e-commerce portals. The retail e-commerce portals needed to behave like completely independent websites with their own customised look and feel.
The solution implemented by us uses REST (or more precisely, POX) to allow any client that has an API key to use the wholesale application's API to list products, create a shopping cart and place orders. Retail e-commerce portals are implemented as web applications that consume the wholesale API, allowing us to spin up new, fully functional retail websites in under thirty minutes.
