          Aninda graduated from BIT Mesra, with a degree in Electronics and
          Communication Engineering which he traded in favor of a life in
          programming. He started his career in HP where he spent 4 years
          learning how not to build software on the .NET platform (which he
          still loves).
          He delved into the world of startups where he was able to make a
          leap of faith into the world of TDD, REST, MVC, DRY, YAGNI, Git,
          ROR and other abbreviated coolness. He fell in love with software
          again and gravitated to a deep appreciation of agile philosophies
          and vows not to leave home without it.
          Aninda is passionate about building elegant working software and
          wanted to work with people who are too, when C42 answered his
          call. Here he plans to actively contribute back to open source,
          build value and live a little on the edge.

          After graduating in Computer Science from <a href="/web/20121130102453/http://pes.edu/">PESIT</a>, Tejas spent two years at
          <a href="/web/20121130102453/http://thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a>, where he was on a team that wrote large scale C# apps.
          His passion has always been in Desktop app, and bridging the gap between online apps and the Desktop.

        <p class="section-content">
          Timothy has been vaguely passionate about computers ever since he got all the way through Prince of Persia when he was five. This grew into a legitimate love for the field after he crashed his Windows box in 2007 and managed a fragile triple-boot system that included a <a href="/web/20121130102453/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSx86">patched version of OS X</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="section-content">
          While he was slacking off from doing his mostly-meaningless Computer Science degree, he discovered an <a href="/web/20121130102453/http://github.com/timothyandrew">interest for coding</a>, and there was no looking back.
        </p>

        <p class="section-content">>
          Having graduated recently, he's eager to put in his <a href="/web/20121130102453/http://norvig.com/21-days.html">10,000 hours</a> and finally get some real-world experience.
