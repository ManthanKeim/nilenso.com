        C42 has been working with our Ruby & Rails teams for the past few months. They've shown a high level of ownership and have been driving improvements in agile practices and Ruby usage in our teams. They've also been contributing to DevOps and infrastructure pieces where needed. We're very happy with their contributions and look forward to continuing our relationship with them.

        It has been a pleasure working with the C42/Nilenso team in the last 15 months. Aakash, Sidu, Nivedita, Smit, Srihari, Timothy, Jithu, Akshay, Srushti, Steve, Neha, Asif, Jasim, Prashant. Each one made significant contribution to our projects, and worked well as 'team of teams'. Exemplary talent, engineering skills, business acumen, commitment and most importantly Empathy. Very happy for this association. Looking forward to seeing them grow together. Wishing good luck and godspeed.

        The coders at C42 are absolutely awesome - they're prolific about writing high quality code, and they've even taught us how to improve our engineering practices. They know how to make offshore development work well, and their communication skills are top-notch. By the end of the first week, they were working at full-speed, building new features and executing on our infinitely long product roadmap. It was easier to onboard C42 than it was to onboard any other developer we've worked with. After interviewing almost a dozen other firms, we ultimately decided to work with C42.

        Niranjan & Tejas from C42 Engineering worked with us for over 4 months, and I can confidently say that they were among the finest folks that we've worked with. We had to wait for a couple of months before they came on board, but the wait was worth its while! These guys know their stuff; they are brilliant in design & coding, and patient & mature to nurture less experienced folks ramp up quickly to adopt agile & TDD principles. Over the short span of our engagement, they provided honest & valuable insights on improving our development processes and made the whole experience memorable for the entire team.

        Working with C42 is a dream. A lot of people gave me offshoring horror stories, but C42 defied all of the warnings and has exceeded my expectations. They're expert Ruby developers, they work hard, and they communicate well. When I need to grow my team, I plan to hire another pair from C42.

          C42 is just the kind of highly competent and agile Rails house we were looking for, to work with us in building a new web product on the lines of Shufflr desktop. Having explored various outsourcing options within and outside Bangalore, I can say that such talent & workmanship is extremely hard to find in Indian tech consulting companies. Good luck to the C42 folks, ahead.

        C42 has been amazing to work with. I've worked primarily with Aakash for the last 3 months, and have been really impressed. He is a rockstar engineer, maintains open channels of communication at all times and demonstrates a strong sense of ownership. Not only does he ensure that the implementation closely matches the business needs, but he also thinks through the user flow and makes great recommendations to improve the overall experience. I've also interacted to a limited extent with the rest of the team, and their values strongly mirror what I've seen with Aakash. I trust C42 completely with my product.
