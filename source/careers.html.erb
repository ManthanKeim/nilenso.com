        <h2>What are we?</h2>
        <p>
            nilenso is an employee-owned technology cooperative in Bangalore.
            We are a completely transparent organisation that believes in self governance.
            Being a part of nilenso means that there are no corporate secrets: we go out of our
            way to inform everyone in the company of our financial position, salaries and future plans.

        <p>We are a completely transparent organisation that believes in self governance.
            We have no corporate secrets: we go out of our way to inform everyone in the
            company of our financial position, salaries and future plans. </p>
        <div class="section-content">
            <h4>Job Responsibility</h4>
            <p>We write Clojure / ClojureScript, Elixir, Go with a dash of Haskell /PureScript, Javascript, Java and Ruby / Rails,
                in the places those languages make sense. We've spent significant time scaling and squeezing runtime performance
                out of Postgres and analytics performance out of HBase and Redshift.</p>
            <p>Most of our code is on the backend, and it makes a lot of sense to us to write backend code in a LISP on the JVM,
                but we're not wedded to it. "Best tool for the job" applies at nilenso -- but the "best" tool needs to be quantified with facts.
                We love facts. We might be knee-deep in Swift or Rust or C (who knows) next year and we're looking for other open-minded
                developers to share their excitement with us. </p>

            <h4>Essentials Got Covered</h4>
            <p>We'll give you all the standard stuff to get your job done: a full workstation and a laptop of your choice
                (most of us have 15" MacBook Pros but we don't discriminate). We'll get you software licenses and a 4G data dongle if
                you need to work from the train. An extensive library (buy any book you want, no questions asked) and frequent
                conference attendance (whether that’s a bicycle ride to Jayanagar or a flight halfway around the world) act as our baseline.</p>
