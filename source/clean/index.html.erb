  <h2 class="section-heading">Zero Waste</h2>

  <p class="section-content">People tend to be confused about Zero Waste. It is often thought to be futuristic, idealistic, or difficult. Thankfully for Bangalore, none of that is true. Once a household or office is comfortable with basic wet/dry segregation, Zero Waste is a natural next step. In this section, we will publish various documents and videos pertaining to waste segregation and Zero Waste. Please help us by providing translations, remixes, and your feedback/ideas.</p>

<div class="segregation bordered-section">
  <h2 class="section-heading">Basic Waste Segregation</h2>

  <p class="section-content">While not everyone is ready for Zero Waste, basic waste segregation is becoming the norm in every city in the world. Children are taught in Elementary school: the difference between organic and inorganic waste, between renewable resources and non-renewable resources. These lessons are taught at this age because they are essential and axiomatic, not because one should ever forget about them. To help adults in every country and in every language, we have released a poster inspired by the <a href="http://www.2bin1bag.in">2bin1bag</a> initiative here in Karnataka. If you are lucky enough to live in Karnataka, please visit their website for locally-applicable resources.</p>

<div class="transportation bordered-section">
  <h2 class="section-heading">Sustainable Transportation</h2>

  <p class="section-content">Depending on where one lives, Bangalore has a few sustainable transportation options:</p>

  <ul class="section-content">
    <li><strong>Walk</strong> - The Bangalore metro area is as large as the major world cities like New York and London. It is not uncommon for people to walk the majority of their commute in these cities and the walking habit is one Bangaloreans will find easier to practice as the metro pulls cars off the road and waste segregation + composting eliminates garbage and leaf fires.</li>

    <li><strong>Bicycle</strong> - Navigation in Bangalore by map (Google or OpenStreetMap) is still tuned to vehicle traffic, but the situation for bicycles is constantly improving. Most roads are comfortable to ride on. Get yourself: good brakes, a helmet, strong nighttime lights, mud guards, and a pollution mask. See <a href="http://blog.deobald.ca/2016/02/howto-bicycle-commute-in-bangalore.html">HOWTO: Bicycle Commute in Bangalore</a></li>

    <li><strong>Metro</strong> - The metro is still under construction, but many of us will take it for the portion of our journey it does cover. The nilenso office is just one street from the Indiranagar metro station.</li>

    <li><strong>Bus</strong> - Bangalore has a healthy bus network. Google Maps will generally get you from A to B by bus without much hassle. You can learn more about Bangalore's extensive bus network from <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/blog/blr-transit-maps/">Sajjad Anwar</a>. Buses still produce local pollution but they are a staple vehicle and electric buses (which will eventually replace them) are common the world over.</li>

    <li><strong>Train</strong> - For those who live toward Bangalore's periphery, a local train may be the best option for the daily commute. Many people don't realize that homes in areas like Tumkur, Whitefield, and Hosur are a short train ride from central Bangalore. Citizen Matters <a href="http://bangalore.citizenmatters.in/articles/trains-for-daily-commute-in-and-around-bengaluru">has written a helpful article on the subject.</a></li>

<div class="cleanoffice bordered-section">
  <h2 class="section-heading">A Clean Office</h2>

  <p class="section-content">Bangalore, being relatiely cosmopolitan, invites a wide variety of cultural backgrounds. A clean office is often best maintained with a few helpful signs:</p>

  <ul class="section-content">
    <li>On waste: <a href="zero_waste_poster_en.pdf">"This is a Zero Waste building."</a></li>
    <li>On washrooms: <a href="washroom_en.pdf">Please keep this washroom clean.</a></li>
