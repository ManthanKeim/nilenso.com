Intro
=====

[ view of city? ]

Bangalore is in crisis. The entire city has garbage piling up in every neighbourhood.

This garbage is either rotting [ rotting pile ], entering waterways [ bags in river ], or on fire [ flaming trash ].

[ hospital beds? ]

Garbage rotting in the streets and waterways causes disease.

[ inhalers, death ]

Burning garbage causes poisoning and asthma. In the case of burning plastic, it causes cancer.

[ frustrated citizen ]

Just where did all this garbage suddenly come from?


Background
==========

Bangalore does not have a pretty waste management story.

[ truck => landfill ]

In the past, Bangalore's garbage has been trucked out of the city to nearby landfills.

[ same landfill + village ]

Unfortunately, these "landfills" are usually near villages -- effectively in someone's backyard.

[ sick people ]

The garbage causes the same problems in villages that it now causes in the city: It's unsanitary and makes everyone sick.

[ angry villagers ]

The citizens of these villages have had enough.

They won't allow garbage to be dumped near their homes any longer -- nor should they.


Opportunity
===========

[ ashamed people, garbage everywhere rotting and on fire ]

Bangalore's garbage crisis disgraces 8.5 million people. But this situation can be more than a cause for shame.

If we use the crisis as an opportunity to encourage everyone to change their behaviour,
Bangalore's waste management can become a source of great pride.

With effort, we can lead other cities -- and even other nations -- in a very short period of time.

Now is the time for awareness.


How?
====

[ helpless-looking person ]

"What can I do?"

Great news! You are the _only_ person who can do _anything_ about this crisis.

The solution must come from _your_ home [ apartment ], _your_ workplace [ office building ], _your_ school [ school ].

[ garbage bag with an X over it? ]

The solution to the crisis begins with segregating waste into 3 categories:

[ green wet waste container ]

One: Wet waste...

[ kitchen & garden waste ]

...such as vegetable peels, cooked food, coffee grinds, and leaves...

[ newspaper full of wet waste going into a green bin ]

...should be kept in newspaper.

[ blue dry waste container ]

Two: Dry waste...

[ plastic, paper, metal, glass, e-waste ]

...such as plastic, paper, metal, glass, and e-waste...

[ assorted dry waste in both a bin and bag ]

...should be kept in a reusable bin or bag.

[ red reject waste container ]

Three: Reject waste...

[ diapers, needles, broken glass ]

...such as sanitary waste, unsafe dry waste, and small quantities of mixed waste such as soiled plastic and soiled paper...

[ marking a red "X" on white paper and placing it in a red bin ]

...should be kept in paper and identified with a clear, red "X".


[ show 3 categories ]

These three categories represent the *bare minimum* segregation required of every citizen in Bangalore.


Troubleshooting
===============

If you do not already segregate, this new system may not be easy at first.

You may run into some troubles. For example:

[ building with only one garbage collection container / point ]

A) If your building does not support wet/dry/reject waste segregation:

- insist to management that segregation starts *immediately*
- OR install separate storage containers yourself.

[ BBMP truck full of garbage bags ]

B) If the BBMP does not collect wet waste every day in your area,
   or does not adhere to these segregation guidelines, contact:

- your local residential society
- OR your local BBMP councellor


Spread the Word!
================

A) Are you finding out about waste segregation at home?

[ lady watching video at home, going to her office and showing everyone on a computer ]

...share this video in your workplace!

B) Are you finding out about waste segregation at work?

[ man watching video with coworkers, going home and showing his wife & kids ]

...share this video at home with your family!


[ lady explaining to her cook ]

C) If you have a cook or employ someone to clean your home (or office),
   ensure he-or-she understands waste segregation and its importance by showing this video.

[ security guard and maid explaining to office manager ]

D) If you cook or clean in someone else's home (or office),
   ensure they understand waste segregation and its importance by showing this video.


Summary
=======

Want a 10-second explanation of everything you just learned to tell your friends? Tell them this:

One:   Bangalore is in a garbage crisis and we must act NOW.
Two:   At all costs, make sure wet/dry/reject segregation is happening both at home and at work.
Three: This is the *bare minimum*. This must become the new normal. This will become the new normal.
       It can either become the new normal because we choose to act now or because we are soon
       forced to change by smoke and disease.

Bangalore is on the cusp of a great change. If we work together, consistently and from now on,
we can be proud of other cities looking to us as a world-class example of a sustainable future.
