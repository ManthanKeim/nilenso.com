	<h3 class="section-heading"><u>Context </u></h3>
	<p class="section-content"> In 2013, after witnessing the failure of in-spirit-but-not-on-shape “software collectives” such as c42 and ActiveSphere, the founders of nilenso wanted a resilient legal structure which could sustain a self-contained institution over any number of employee or founder exits.</p>
	<h3 class="section-heading"><u>Decision </u></h3>
	<p class="section-content"> We evaluated an array of structures: Umbrella, Founder-based, Equity-based, “decaying” equity-based, and co-operatives. Only an employee-owned (worker co-operative could meet our institution requirement over medium  and long-term modeling. This decision was also based on what would appeal most to potential employees in the long run.</p>
	<h3 class="section-heading"><u> Status: </u>Accepted</h3>
	<h3 class="section-heading"><u>Consequences </u></h3>
	<p class="section-content">This worked. People frequently say the want to work with us because we are a Cb-op. 6.f8 founding members have left whitout disrupting nilenso’s active employee ownership and control. </p>
	<p class="section-content"> Beyond control, a formal co-operative also dictates seven principles which the corporation must abide by:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Voluntary, open ownership.</li>
	  <li>Democratic owner control.</li>
	  <li>Owner economic participation.</li>
	  <li>Autonomy and independence.</li>
	  <li>Education, trainin, information.</li>
	  <li>Cooperation among co-operatives.</li>
	  <li>Concern for community.</li>
	</ol> 
	<p class="section-content">Points #4 - #7 heavily influence or long-term operations where #1-#3 are more structural. Operational points were not taken seriously until much later in nilenso’s evolution.</p>
