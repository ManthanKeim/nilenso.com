	<h2 class="section-heading">Provide (cautious) sabbaticals</h2>

	<h3 class="section-miniheading"><u>Context</u></h3>
	<p class="section-content">Initially, it was a collective desire within nilenso that members could take sabbaticals whenever they want.</p>
	<p class="section-content">Sabbaticals (extended, unpaid leave) taken in nilenso’s early years were disruptive to clients and to our own business.</p>

	<h3 class="section-miniheading"><u>Decision</u></h3>
	<p class="section-content">Sabbaticals are permitted given a discussion with the entire team and plenty of lead time to notify the client and/or prepare for a member’s absence. <a href="http://readme.nilenso.com/index.php/Sabbatical_Policy">See official policy.</a></p>

	<h3 class="section-miniheading"><u>Status:</u> Accepted.</h3>

	<h3 class="section-miniheading"><u>Consequences</u></h3>
	<p class="section-content">The new sabbatical policy has worked well as relief from stressful projects, wedding/honeymoon leave, etc. it has proved a minimum disruption but should be treated with due respect, given our earlier failures with sabbaticals.</p>
