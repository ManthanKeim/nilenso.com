                It is our mission to continuously do better. We have grown a small web shop into a team of
                developers and designers tackling
                challenges in data science and experimentation, machine learning runtimes, complex systems
                integration, large data set
                analysis, and low-latency realtime systems. Our love of technology is born from helping our
                clients solve difficult problems
                and we would love to hear from you if you have a challenge for us.

                For us, self-improvement has another facet: impact. We want to improve the world around us.
                Software is emerging as a key
                component of infrastructure, international development, open government, transportation,
                agriculture, and
                the arts.

                Our primary goal is to find people and organizations to partner with who feel the same way.
                If you prefer working on open source, with open data, in open and transparent fields, we want to
                talk to you.

                This service was built for an Indonesian Uber competitor. Matching drivers to riders is perhaps
                the most crucial runtime behaviour of any rideshare business. This is the first interaction any
                customer will have with the application. It is also the most common. Failures quickly multiply
                in the minds of users (riders and drivers, both). We were tasked with rewriting a fragile and
                bug-ridden Allocation Service written in Go. For this project, we convinced the client to use
                Clojure, deploying their first production Clojure code.
